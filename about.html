        Hi! My name is Kanika Asavari Vaish, and I am an NYC-based writer, director, producer, and performer. My work focuses on themes of hope, transformation, and community. Shaped by the work of artists like Tig Notaro, Lynn Nottage, Lisa Kron, and David Henry Hwang,  I believe in using theater as a form of collective healing, social resistance, and community empowerment.
        <br><br>
        I am the co-artistic director of South Asian theater ensemble and incubator <a href='https://www.freshlimesoda.co/'>Fresh Lime Soda Productions</a>, which I co-founded with Sabina Sethi Unni in January 2020. FLSP actively seeks to dismantle traditional barriers to access in theater, focused on producing virtual and in-person politically-motivated new plays and talkbacks, connecting early-career artists with one another, and fostering a social community for South Asian artists and theater lovers around the world. 
        <br><br>
        I am a recent MFA Playwriting graduate of Columbia University School of the Arts. Prior to Columbia, I worked as a legal assistant at a major law firm in Washington, D.C., where I observed non-theatrical but similarly engaging, persuasive, and  ensemble-based storytelling.
        <br><br>
        I am a proud alum of  Wellesley College, where I studied English & Political Science, directed two plays by Rajiv Joseph, and acted in several Wellesley College Shakespeare Society productions. My senior thesis, a collection of semi-autobiographical short stories entitled Jet Lag, advised by poet Octavio Gonzalez, won the Charlotte Paul Reese '38 Memorial Prize for Creativity in a Collection of Short Fiction.
        <br><br>
        I was born in New York, and spent my teenage years in Mumbai, India.
        <br><br>
        Some of my favorite things include: jumping into cold water, eating ripe plums, interacting with animals (domesticated and wild ones alike), wearing evocative socks, zooming in on maps, curating playlists, drinking any kind of citrus juice (especially fresh lime soda), gazing at mountains, finding black raspberry ice cream, hearing people laugh, applying neon eyeliner, and making breakfast sandwiches for loved ones.
        <br><br>
        If you would like to get to know my work better or collaborate on a project, feel free to reach out.
        <br><br>
        My resumes (Playwriting, Directing, Acting, and Administrative) are available upon request.
